# Thunder VSCode Extension

Thunder is a REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code. It is a lightweight and easy-to-use extension for sending HTTP requests to test your REST API. it is a good alternative to Postman. Now I use it for all my tests. you'll find the collections of requests in this folder. You can import them in your thunder extension. So you now, there is a free plan limiting the number of requests per day.
