.Overview

== Introduction
*THIS DOCUMENTATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS ACCURATE BUT NOT COMPLETE.*
This is a sample of the documentation for the Ticket To The Moon API. The Ticket To The Moon (TTTM) API is the backend of the ticket office website of which you can find the full documentation at {url-repo}. The API is used to manage the following resources ordered in categories event, ticket, reservation and customer order.

== Authentication
{next}

== HTTP verbs
The HTTP method of an endpoint defines the type of action it performs on a given resource. Some common HTTP methods are GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH. The REST API reference documentation provides the HTTP method for every endpoint.
Where possible, the TTTM REST API strives to use an appropriate HTTP method for each action.

== HTTP status codes

|Status Code | Meaning | Description | API Usage
| **2xx Successful** | Indicates the request was successful. | Most common response for successful API requests. |
| 200 | OK | The request was successful and the response body contains requested data. | Default response for successful GET requests.
| 201 Created | Created | A new resource was created successfully. | Often used for POST requests that create new data.

== HTTP status error codes

[%header,cols=4*]

|===
|Status Code | Meaning | Description | API Usage

| **4xx Client Error** | Indicates an error with the client's request. | Frequent in API interactions, usually accompanied by an error message in the response body. |
| 400 Bad Request | Bad Request | The request is invalid due to syntax errors or missing required information. | Common error for malformed requests or missing data. 
| 401 Unauthorized | Unauthorized | The client is not authorized to access the requested resource. | Used when authentication fails or required credentials are missing. 
| 403 Forbidden | Forbidden | The client is authorized, but access to the resource is still denied. | Used for permission-related errors or restricted resources. 
| 404 Not Found | Not Found | The requested resource could not be found. | Common error for non-existent resources or invalid IDs. 
| 405 Method Not Allowed | Method Not Allowed | The requested HTTP method is not supported for the resource. | Used when trying to use an incorrect verb (e.g., GET instead of POST) for an operation. 
| 409 Conflict | Conflict | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource. | Often used for concurrent updates or conflicting data.
| 422 Unprocessable Entity | Unprocessable Entity | The request was well-formed but could not be processed due to semantic errors. | Often used for validation errors in data submissions. 
| **5xx Server Error** | | Indicates an error on the server side. | Less common than client errors, but can still occur due to internal server issues. 
| 500 Internal Server Error | Internal Server Error | An unexpected error occurred on the server. | Generic error message, often accompanied by logs for debugging. 
| 503 Service Unavailable | Service Unavailable | The server is currently unavailable or overloaded. | Used when the server is temporarily unable to handle requests. |
